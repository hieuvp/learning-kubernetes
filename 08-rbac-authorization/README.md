## Key Concepts

Verbs: This is a set of operations that can be executed on resources. There are many verbs, but theyâ€™re all Create, Read, Update, or Delete (also known as CRUD).
API Resources: These are the objects available on the clusters. They are the pods, services, nodes, PersistentVolumes and other things that make up Kubernetes.
Subjects: These are the objects (users, groups, processes) allowed access to the API, based on Verbs and Resources.
